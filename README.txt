No special instructions to run this program. Just run it through PyCharm.

Also, class files aren't necessary at the moment - they haven't been implemented into main.py just yet.

!! A note on how complete this project is:
    This project is really in a bare-bones state of what it should be. I started a bit behind the curve on my CS abilities,
    so I wasn't as efficient as my classmates. However, I'm excited to continue working on this in the future

    Items I'm hoping to implement in the future:
    - A formula where I can analyze the specific points on the scatterplot
    - Using the number derived from the formula to find election results
    - Predicting the election results with machine learning (using a process where I use the formula on multiple 10-year
      groups of elections.
